ABSTRACT:
Changes in past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations can
be determined by measuring the composition of air trapped in ice
cores from Antarctica. So far, the Antarctic Vostok and EPICA
Dome C ice cores have provided a composite record of atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels over the past 650,000 years. Here we present 
results of the lowest 200m of the Dome C ice core, extending 
the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by two 
complete glacial cycles to 800,000 yr before present. From 
previously published data and the present work, we find that
atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic
temperature throughout eight glacial cycles but with significantly
lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 yr before present.
Carbon dioxide levels are below 180 parts per million by volume 
(p.p.m.v.) for a period of 3,000 yr during Marine Isotope Stage 16, 
possibly reflecting more pronounced oceanic carbon storage. 
We report the lowest carbon dioxide concentration measured
in an ice core, which extends the pre-industrial range of
carbon dioxide concentrations during the late Quaternary by
about 10 p.p.m.v. to 172-300 p.p.m.v.
