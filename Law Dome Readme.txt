ABSTRACT (MacFarling Meure et al. 2006):
New measurements of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in ice
from Law Dome, Antarctica reproduce published Law Dome CO2 and CH4
records, extend them back to 2000 years BP, and include N2O.
They have very high air age resolution, data density and measurement
precision. Firn air measurements span the past 65 years and overlap
with the ice core and direct atmospheric observations. Major increases
in CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations during the past 200 years followed
a period of relative stability beforehand. Decadal variations during
the industrial period include the stabilization of CO2 and slowing
of CH4 and N2O growth in the 1940s and 1950s. Variations of up to
10 ppm CO2, 40 ppb CH4 and 10 ppb N2O occurred throughout the
preindustrial period.  Methane concentrations grew by 100 ppb
from AD 0 to 1800, possibly due to early anthropogenic emissions.


GEOGRAPHIC REGION: Antarctica
PERIOD OF RECORD: 0 - 2000 AD

DESCRIPTION:
Law Dome ice core (DSS, DE08 and DE08-2), firn air (DSSW20K),
and Cape Grim instrumental (deseasonalised archive, insitu and flask)
records of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations for the past 2000 years.

Law Dome location: The dome summit is as follows, 
individual cores are within about 25 km (see publications)
66°44'S, 112°50'E, 1390m elevation.

Measurement precision for the ice core air samples is 4.1 ppb CH4, 
1.1 ppm CO2, and 6.5 ppb N2O. Measurement precision for the firn air 
samples is 2 ppb CH4, 0.1 ppm CO2 and 0.3 ppb N2O.

Ice core concentrations are adjusted for small system enhancements
(1.1 ± 0.8 ppm for CO2, 4.1 ± 4.0 ppb for CH4, and 1.8 ± 0.9 ppb for N2O)
as described in MacFarling Meure et al. (2006) and for the effects of
gravitational fractionation, also small, as described in Etheridge et al.
1996, 1998.

Air age spread is 10-12 years for DE08/-2 ice samples, 
18-20 years for DSS ice samples and 5 years for DSSW20K firn air samples. 
See Trudinger et al., 2002 for statistical definitions.

DE08 and DE08-2 ice core air dating uncertainty is less than +/- 3 years.
DSS ice core air dating uncertainty is less than +/- 5 years.

DSS ice dating has been revised based on new accumulation rates and
temperatures (van Ommen, T., V. Morgan and M.A.J. Curran. 2004.
Deglacial and Holocene changes in accumulation at Law Dome, East Antarctica,
Annals Glaciol., 39, 359-365.; MacFarling Meure 2004).

The dating of published DSS concentrations have been adjusted by less than
5 years under the new chronology.
